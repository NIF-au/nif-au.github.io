Criteria for determining merit include: • Scientific excellence of the research proposal • Appropriateness of methods provided by AMBMC to research questions posed by the investigator • Ability of the AMBMC to meet the requirements of the investigator • Capacity of the investigator to meet the costs of the study • Capability and track record of the research team, including ability of the investigator to provide model animals in a timely manner in a laboratory which complies with the NHMRC code of practice. • The alignment of the project with the national research priorities. • The industrial and social impact of the project for the wider Australian community.

Priority will be given to projects funded under peer-reviewed competitive granting schemes.

## Access Arrangements
Access arrangements will be guided by the following principles:

All users will be treated the same regardless of their host organisation.
